model_output: 
model_repo: 

model_targets: weekly / cumulative incidences & deaths
target_loc: Germany and Poland
Data_format: percentile estimates
forecast_startdate: 2020-10-12
forecast_frequency: once per week

data_inputs_known: county level incidences by age group; distribution for time to death and proportion of deaths in each age group
data_source_known: RKI, ECDC, Polish patient data

this_model_is_unconditional: yes

methods: >-
    Forecasts of county level incidence based on regional reproduction numbers.

methods_long: >-
    Using county level incidence data we estimate regional reproduction numbers
    with a small area estimation approach. These estimates are the basis for 
    simulations of future incidences which are then aggregated to the state or
    national level. Deaths are predicted by age groups and use estimated case fatality
    ratios.
